# hello-world
my first repository

I am a physics student at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, expected graduation in May 2019.  I am from Lancaster, NY, which is a suburb about 20 minutes outside of Buffalo and about a half hour from the Canadian border.  I am at RPI for the summer of 2017 doing research on CT (computed tomography) tube current modulation with Prof. Caracappa in the Nuclear Engineering department.
